A clean, playful TypeScript experiment with a subtle Japanese-inspired glow.
This small project creates an interactive button. On odd clicks, the surrounding wrapper transforms into a soft circular "lantern" or balloon with an inner glow. On even clicks, everything resets to a crisp, modern rectangular look.

## Overview

Click away and enjoy the subtle shift between sharp modernity and soft, glowing serenity.
Simple, satisfying, and just a little bit Japanese. Dōzoお楽しみください! 🙏
